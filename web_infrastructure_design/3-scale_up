 Application Server vs Web Server Infrastructure

 Infrastructure Overview
This setup uses 3 servers with separated components:

Server 1: Web Server (Nginx)

Server 2: Application Server

Server 3: Database Server (MySQL)

Additionally, there are 2 load balancers (HAProxy) configured in a cluster for high availability.

Why Add Each Component?
Separate Servers for Web, Application, and Database:
Improves performance by isolating roles.
Easier to maintain, scale, and secure each part independently.

Load Balancers (HAProxy Cluster):
Distributes traffic between web servers for load balancing and failover.
Clustering of load balancers ensures no single point of failure.

One Server (conceptual) in the stack:
Represents each role clearly: web server handles HTTP requests, application server runs business logic, and database server manages data.

Summary
Separating web, application, and database servers along with clustered load balancers creates a more reliable, scalable, and maintainable web infrastructure.
