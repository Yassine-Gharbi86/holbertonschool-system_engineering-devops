     [ Primary DB ] ----> [ Replica DB ]


‚úÖ Why We Add These Components
Load Balancer (HAProxy):

Distributes traffic between servers to improve performance and availability.

Prevents one server from getting overloaded.

Two App Servers (Server 1 & 2):

Improves redundancy and allows scaling.

If one fails, the other still handles traffic.

Primary-Replica Database Setup:

Ensures data redundancy and better performance.

Writes go to Primary DB; Reads can go to Replica DB.

üîÅ Load Balancer Details
Distribution Algorithm:

Round Robin (RR):
Sends requests to each server in order, one by one (Server 1, then Server 2, then back to Server 1, etc.).

Active-Active Setup:

Both servers handle traffic at the same time.

Active-Passive means one server is on standby, used only if the other fails.

üõ¢Ô∏è Database Cluster: Primary-Replica (Master-Slave)
Primary Node (Master):

Handles all write operations (e.g., creating new users).

Replica Node (Slave):

Syncs data from Primary.

Can handle read-only queries (e.g., viewing posts).

Replication:

Done asynchronously or semi-synchronously from Primary to Replica.

‚ö†Ô∏è Issues with This Setup
SPOF (Single Point of Failure):

The load balancer is a SPOF. If it goes down, nothing gets through.

Security Issues:

No firewall = exposed to network attacks.

No HTTPS = insecure data transmission.

No Monitoring:

If a server fails, no alerts or automatic recovery.

No performance tracking or logging.
