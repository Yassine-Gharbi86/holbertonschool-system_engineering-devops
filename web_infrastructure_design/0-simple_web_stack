üí° Scenario
A user wants to access www.foobar.com through their browser.

The browser checks the domain name www.foobar.com, which is mapped to the IP address 8.8.8.8 using a DNS A record.

This IP points to our one server where everything is hosted.

‚úÖ Infrastructure Components
Domain Name: foobar.com

DNS Record: www is a subdomain and the A record points it to 8.8.8.8.

Server: A single machine at IP 8.8.8.8 that runs all services:

Web Server (Nginx): Handles incoming HTTP requests and serves static content or forwards requests to the application server.

Application Server: Runs the application code (e.g., Python, PHP) and generates dynamic content.

Application Files: The actual codebase of the website.

Database (MySQL): Stores all dynamic data like users, products, reviews, etc.

Communication: The server communicates with the user's browser over the HTTP/HTTPS protocol.

üìö Definitions
Server: A powerful computer that provides services to other computers (clients) over a network.

Domain Name: A human-readable address (like foobar.com) that maps to a server‚Äôs IP using DNS.

DNS A Record: Maps a domain (like www.foobar.com) to an IP address.

Web Server (Nginx): Manages HTTP requests, serves static files, and passes dynamic requests to the application.

Application Server: Processes the logic of the website (e.g., rendering pages, processing forms).

Database: Stores structured data used by the application (e.g., MySQL stores user info, posts, etc.).

Communication Protocol: HTTP/HTTPS is used to transfer data between the server and the user‚Äôs browser.

‚ö†Ô∏è Issues with This Setup
SPOF (Single Point of Failure): If the one server fails, the whole website is down.

Maintenance Downtime: Restarting the server (e.g., after updates) makes the site temporarily unavailable.

No Scalability: The server cannot handle a large number of users at once. More traffic = slower performance or crashes.
